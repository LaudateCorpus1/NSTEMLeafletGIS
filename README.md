# NSTEM Leaflet GIS
This project is specifically programmed to help display the hundreds
of Educated Affiliated Partners of NSTEM on a map located on nstem.org.

## Installation
Simply import the single_leaflet.js file into your HTML page with the
current credentials as well as make sure to have the correct HTML elements
with the corresponding IDs written in code.

## Updates
A detailed README.md will be drafted by Pirjot for interns who look to 
maintain or change the project. Documentation for many of the functions
has yet to be written. Thank you for your patience!
